# Problem Statement

You work as a Data Scientist at a multinational corporation. The Public relations department team has collected extensive data on their customers such as product reviews. Based on the reviews(in text format), the team would like to predict whether their customers are satisfied with their product or not.


# Understanding NLP

* Natural Language Processing can be used to build predictive models to perform sentiment analysis on social media posts and reviews and predict if customers are happy or not.
* NLP work by converting words into numbers and training a machine learning models to make predictions.
* That way, you can automatically know if your customers are happy or not without manually going through massive number of tweets or reviews!

# steps involved in NLP:

1.Removing Punctuations 

3.Removing Stopwords

4.Tokenization(Count Vectorization)

5.TF-IDF


# Things covered

* Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on the dataset like Heatmap to find missing values, Histograms, Count Plots, Bar Plots and word cloud visualizations.

* Performed Data Cleaning like removing unwanted columns and converting categorical columns into numerical using OneHotEncoding.

* Apply natural language processing toolkit to remove punctuations, stopwords and to perform tokenization.

* Apply feature extraction using count vectorizers.

* Training a naive bayes classifier model and logistic regression classifier model on the data.

* Applied classification metrics like confusion matrix and classification report to understand the performance of the model.
